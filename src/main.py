This proogram simulates a cybersecurity penetration testing process.

This program emulates the key stages of a network penetration test:
1. Preparation
2. Network scanning / information gathering
3. Vulnerability detection and analysis
4. Exploitation phase
5. Risk Assesment
6. Final Report generation

The simulation is limited to analyzing network logs and does not perform actual network operations.
The reports generated in this process are not actual cases, but dummy examples.
